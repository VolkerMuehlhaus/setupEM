"""
Import ADS Momentum stackup exports (*.subst + materials.matdb, and *.ltd) into a
stackup XML tree, using the same stackup_writer API the Stackup Editor's other
mutations go through - so an imported stackup is a normal, editable, validated tree
like any loaded/hand-built one.

This is a general-purpose importer: it processes every material/dielectric/layer/via
in the source file uniformly. It carries no process- or vendor-specific assumptions
(no hardcoded layer names, colors, or skip lists) - unlike the older, IHP-SG13G2-specific
momentum_to_xml.py script this replaces the GUI-facing need for.

Both formats describe a physical stack from an open-ended top boundary (Momentum
models this as an unbounded half-space, not a finite material) down to a substrate,
sometimes terminated by a backside ground plane. The target schema needs a finite
top thickness to bound the simulation domain, so air_thickness_um is a required
parameter (the caller is expected to prompt for it) rather than silently guessed. A
backside ground plane (*.subst's <interface groundplane="1">, *.ltd's BOTTOM COVERED)
is modeled as a synthetic Dielectric slab at the very bottom of the stack (see
_GROUND_PLANE_THICKNESS_UM/_GROUND_PLANE_CONDUCTIVITY below) - a Dielectric rather
than a Layer, deliberately: a Layer only produces geometry where a matching GDSII
polygon exists on its layer number, which a full-wafer backside ground plane has no
reason to have in an arbitrary layout, whereas a Dielectric automatically covers the
whole simulation domain, the same way AIR/Substrate/EPI already do.
